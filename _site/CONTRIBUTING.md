## Please Read Before Submitting a Pull Request

- The main reason that I made this project is to learn JavaScript. My JS knowledge is still limited, and I would like to make sure I can understand all of the code in this repository. If your pull request contains coding concepts that I still don't understand, I might not accept the pull request. Sorry in advance.
- I'd like to keep the API really, really simple. I probably will not implement or accept a pull request containing a new API/feature unless a lot of people request it.
